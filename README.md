# Apache Ozone Website v2

Welcome to the development branch of the new and improved Apache Ozone website. The new site is being built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). See the [Docusaurus docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs) for details on working with this framework.

## Relevant Links

- [HDDS-9225](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDDS-9225) is the parent Jira tracking current tasks required to get the new website ready for deployment.
- Attached to this Jira is a [document](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/13062569/Improving%20the%20Apache%20Ozone%20Website.pdf) outlining the long term plan required to get the new website ready for deployment.
- This [Apache mail thread](https://lists.apache.org/thread/fooxgc81cbglpl8kcfxr5mfgm9qrf5v1) is the original dev mailing thread discussing the new Ozone website.

## Branches

- Development of the new website is currently happening on the `HDDS-9225-website-v2` branch. All changes specific to the new website should be merged into this branch.

- The `master` branch is still tracking content for the currently active Ozone website. `master` and `HDDS-9225-website-v2` will remain separate until the new website is ready to be deployed.

- The `asf-site` branch is still holding build artifacts being used to deploy content from the `master` branch. The new website is not being hosted anywhere, but can be previewed locally.

## Previewing the New Website Locally

You will need a Node package manager like npm, yarn, or pnpm installed to run these commands. Once installed, there are two ways to preview the website locally. Each option will launch the site at `localhost:3000` on your machine.

1. **Development Server** (See [Docusaurus docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation#running-the-development-server))

- This option will start the Docusaurus development server. It will not produce a `build` directory with build artifacts, and allows updates to website files to be displayed in the browser in real time.

- Run `npm run start` from the repository root to start the development server.

2. **Local Build** (See [Docusaurus docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation#build))

- This option will do a production build, putting artifacts in the `build` directory. This can still be previewed locally, but will not automatically reflect changes to website files.

- Run `npm run build` from the repository root to build the content.

- Run `npm run serve` to preview the built website locally.

## Updating the Website

- `docusaurus.config.js`
  - The main configuration file for the docusaurus site.
  - See https://docusaurus.io/docs/configuration

- `sidebars.js`
  - Configuration of the documentation menu. This file should not need to be modified since the menu will be auto-generated from the directory and file layout.
  - See https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar/autogenerated

- `static`
  - Contains non-code files that are directly copied to the build output.
  - See https://docusaurus.io/docs/static-assets
  - `static/img`
    - Directory for all images needed to build the site.

- `src/pages`
  - Static pages outside of the documentation section.
  - See https://docusaurus.io/docs/creating-pages

- `docs`
  - Documentation pages.
  - See https://docusaurus.io/docs/create-doc
