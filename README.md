# Apache Ozone Website v2

Welcome to the development branch of the new and improved Apache Ozone website. The new site is being built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). See the [Docusaurus docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs) for details on working with this framework.

## Relevant Links

- [HDDS-9225](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDDS-9225) is the parent Jira tracking current tasks required to get the new website ready for deployment.

- Attached to this Jira is a [document](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/13062569/Improving%20the%20Apache%20Ozone%20Website.pdf) outlining the long term plan required to get the new website ready for deployment.

- This [Apache mail thread](https://lists.apache.org/thread/fooxgc81cbglpl8kcfxr5mfgm9qrf5v1) is the original dev mailing thread discussing the new Ozone website.

## Branches

- Development of the new website is currently happening on the `HDDS-9225-website-v2` branch. All changes specific to the new website should be merged into this branch.

- The `master` branch is still tracking content for the currently active Ozone website. `master` and `HDDS-9225-website-v2` will remain separate until the new website is ready to be deployed.

- The `asf-site` branch is still holding build artifacts being used to deploy content from the `master` branch. The new website is not being hosted anywhere, but can be previewed locally.

## Local Development

### Setup

1. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation), which will be used to build the site.

2. Install dependencies required to build the website by running `pnpm install` at the website root.

### Preview

Once installed, there are two ways to preview the website locally. Each option will launch the site at `localhost:3000` on your machine.

- **Development Server** (See [Docusaurus docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation#running-the-development-server)): This option will start the Docusaurus development server. It will not produce a `build` directory with build artifacts, and allows updates to website files to be displayed in the browser in real time.

  1. Run `pnpm start` from the repository root to start the development server.

- **Local Build** (See [Docusaurus docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation#build)): This option will do a production build, putting artifacts in the `build` directory. This can still be previewed locally, but will not automatically reflect changes to website files.

  1. Run `pnpm build` from the repository root to build the content.

  2. Run `pnpm serve` to preview the built website locally.

### Updating the Website

The following files can be modified to change various aspects of the website:

- `docusaurus.config.js`
  - The main configuration file for the docusaurus site.
  - See https://docusaurus.io/docs/configuration

- `sidebars.js`
  - Configuration of the documentation menu sidebars.
  - This file should not need to be modified since the menu will be auto-generated from the directory and file layout.
  - See https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar/autogenerated

- `static`
  - Contains non-code files that are directly copied to the build output.
  - See https://docusaurus.io/docs/static-assets
  - `static/img`
    - Directory for all images needed to build the site.

- `docs`
  - Documentation pages.
  - See https://docusaurus.io/docs/create-doc

- `src/pages`
  - Static pages outside of the documentation section.
  - See https://docusaurus.io/docs/creating-pages
