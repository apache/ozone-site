# Apache Ozone Website v2

Welcome to the development branch of the new and improved Apache Ozone website. The new site is being built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). See the [Docusaurus docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs) for details on working with this framework. The `progress.sh` script can be used to get an approximation of how many pages are remaining before the website is ready.

You can preview the current state of the new website at https://ozone-site-v2.staged.apache.org.

## Context

- [HDDS-9225](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDDS-9225) is the parent Jira tracking current tasks required to get the new website ready for deployment.

- Attached to this Jira is a [document](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/13062569/Improving%20the%20Apache%20Ozone%20Website.pdf) outlining the long term plan required to get the new website ready for deployment.

- This [Apache mail thread](https://lists.apache.org/thread/fooxgc81cbglpl8kcfxr5mfgm9qrf5v1) is the original dev mailing thread discussing the new Ozone website.

## Branches

- Development of the new website is currently happening on the `HDDS-9225-website-v2` branch. All changes specific to the new website should be merged into this branch.

- The `master` branch is still tracking content for the currently active Ozone website. `master` and `HDDS-9225-website-v2` will remain separate until the new website is ready to be deployed.

- The `asf-site` branch is still holding build artifacts being used to deploy content from the `master` branch.
