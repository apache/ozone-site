# Apache Ozone Website v2

Welcome to the development branch of the new and improved Apache Ozone website. The new site is being built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/). See the [Docusaurus docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs) for details on working with this framework.

## Relevant Links

- [HDDS-9225](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDDS-9225) is the parent Jira tracking current tasks required to get the new website ready for deployment.

- Attached to this Jira is a [document](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/13062569/Improving%20the%20Apache%20Ozone%20Website.pdf) outlining the long term plan required to get the new website ready for deployment.

- This [Apache mail thread](https://lists.apache.org/thread/fooxgc81cbglpl8kcfxr5mfgm9qrf5v1) is the original dev mailing thread discussing the new Ozone website.

## Branches

- Development of the new website is currently happening on the `HDDS-9225-website-v2` branch. All changes specific to the new website should be merged into this branch.

- The `master` branch is still tracking content for the currently active Ozone website. `master` and `HDDS-9225-website-v2` will remain separate until the new website is ready to be deployed.

- The `asf-site` branch is still holding build artifacts being used to deploy content from the `master` branch. The new website is not being hosted anywhere, but can be previewed locally.
