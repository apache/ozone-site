    <description>Apache Ozone is a highly scalable, distributed storage for Analytics, Big data and Cloud Native applications. Ozone supports S3 compatible object APIs as well as a Hadoop Compatible File System implementation. It is optimized for both efficient object store and file system operations.
It is built on a highly available, replicated block storage layer called Hadoop Distributed Data Store (HDDS).
Applications using frameworks like Apache Spark, YARN and Hive work natively without any modifications. </description>
