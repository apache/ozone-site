# Bucket Level Encryption

## Transparent Data Encryption - TDE

Buckets can be configured for Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) at the time of creation.
When TDE is enabled, all data written to the bucket is automatically encrypted at rest using a specified encryption key.
For detailed steps on setting up and using TDE, refer to the [Securing TDE documentation](../../../administrator-guide/configuration/security/encryption/transparent-data-encryption).
