# Using an HDFS Client With Ozone

Link to HDFS documentation to install and configure an HDFS client. Document how to configure it to work against Ozone. This should also include which interfaces it supports (ofs, s3a).

**TODO:** File a subtask under [HDDS-9858](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDDS-9858) and complete this page or section.
