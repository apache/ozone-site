# The Ozone Client

Document how to install, configure and run Ozone's client. This should also include

- Which interfaces it supports (ofs, o3, Java).
- Information about configuration files it reads (core-site.xml, client log4j).
- Environment variables and common JVM flags (`-D`) that can be used at the CLI.

**TODO:** File a subtask under [HDDS-9858](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDDS-9858) and complete this page or section.
