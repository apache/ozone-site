# Using an S3 Client With Ozone

Document how to set it up an S3 client to run against Ozone (access key and secret key).

- Any S3 compatible client should work against Ozone's S3 interface.
- The Ozone Java client is not required to be present, but can be used to generate secrets.
- A kerberos principal is required to initially generate a secret.

**TODO:** File a subtask under [HDDS-9858](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDDS-9858) and complete this page or section.
