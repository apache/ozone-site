# Ozone Shell

The Ozone Shell, invoked via `ozone sh`, is a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with Apache Ozone. It's primarily designed for administrative tasks and basic data management operations.

## Overview

The Ozone Shell communicates directly with the Ozone Manager (OM) using Ozone's native RPC protocol. It provides commands organized into subcommands for different resource types (volume, bucket, key, etc.).

**Key Uses:**

*   Managing volumes (create, delete, list, info, set owner/quota).
*   Managing buckets (create, delete, list, info, set properties like versioning, replication, layout, encryption, owner, quota).
*   Managing ACLs (set, get, add, remove) for volumes, buckets, and keys.
*   Basic key/object operations (put, get, delete, list, info).
*   Managing snapshots (create, delete, list, rename).
*   Interacting with the S3 secret management system (for multi-tenancy).
*   Performing administrative actions like decommissioning nodes or triggering background tasks.

## Syntax

The general syntax is:

```bash
ozone sh <resource> <action> [options] <path>
```

*   `<resource>`: The type of resource (e.g., `volume`, `bucket`, `key`, `snapshot`, `s3`, `admin`).
*   `<action>`: The operation to perform (e.g., `create`, `list`, `info`, `delete`, `setacl`).
*   `[options]`: Command-specific flags (e.g., `--quota`, `--layout`, `--acl`).
*   `<path>`: The Ozone path to the resource (e.g., `/volumeName`, `/volumeName/bucketName`, `/volumeName/bucketName/keyName`).

## Examples

```bash
# Create a volume
ozone sh volume create /data-vol

# Create a bucket with specific layout and quota
ozone sh bucket create --layout FSO --quota 100GB /data-vol/analytics

# Put a local file into Ozone
ozone sh key put /data-vol/analytics/input.csv /path/to/local/input.csv

# List keys in a bucket
ozone sh key list /data-vol/analytics

# Get information about a key
ozone sh key info /data-vol/analytics/input.csv

# Set an ACL on a bucket
ozone sh bucket setacl /data-vol/analytics --acl user:analyst:rw

# Get help for a specific command
ozone sh bucket create --help
```

## When to Use

The Ozone Shell (`o3`) is best suited for:

*   **Administrators:** Performing cluster setup, configuration, and management tasks.
*   **Scripting:** Automating administrative actions.
*   **Basic Data Exploration:** Simple listing, uploading, downloading, or deleting of objects.

It is generally **not** recommended for high-performance data access within applications or for complex filesystem operations, where interfaces like `ofs://`, `s3a://`, or the Java API are more appropriate.
