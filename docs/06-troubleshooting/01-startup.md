# Troubleshooting Startup

**TODO:** File a subtask under [HDDS-9860](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDDS-9860) and complete this page or section.
**TODO:** Allow inclusion of the troubleshooting folder by updating the excludes list in `docusaurus.config.js`.

If issues that show up here are caused by other problems (like certificates), this page should link to the troubleshooting pages for those aspects.
