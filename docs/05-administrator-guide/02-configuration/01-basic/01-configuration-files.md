# Configuration Files

**TODO:** File a subtask under [HDDS-9859](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDDS-9859) and complete this page or section.

Document `ozone-site.xml` and `core-site.xml` configuration files for the Ozone server, their basic format, and where they are read from. Specific config keys will be documented in later sections.
