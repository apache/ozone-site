# Configuring Ozone Administrators

**TODO:** File a subtask under [HDDS-9859](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDDS-9859) and complete this page or section.

Ozone has many configurations for administrators. Document their default values, and usage of ozone admin users and groups, recon admin users and groups, and s3 admin user and groups.
