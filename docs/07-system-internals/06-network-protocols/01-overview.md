# Overview of Network Protocols Used Within Ozone

**TODO:** File a subtask under [HDDS-9862](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDDS-9862) and complete this page or section.

Provide a list of the different network protocols used within Ozone (gRPC, Hadoop RPC, Netty, HTTP) their purpose, and how they are secured (TLS, SASL). A system diagram with each connection's protocol labelled would be good to have here too.
