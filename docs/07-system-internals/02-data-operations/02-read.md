# Implementation of Read Operations

**TODO:** File a subtask under [HDDS-9862](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDDS-9862) and complete this page or section.

## Reading Metadata

## Reading Data

Trace every part of a read request from beginning to end. This includes:
- Client getting encryption keys
- Client calling OM to create key
- OM validating client's Kerberos princiapl
- OM checking permissions (Ranger or Native ACLs)
- OM generating block tokens from the shared secret previously retreived from SCM
- OM getting block locations from SCM or from its cache.
- OM returning container, blocks, pipeline, block tokens
- Client sending block tokens and datanode validating based on the shared secret from SCM
- Client sending read chunk requests to datanode to fetch the data.
    - For replication:
        - Include topology choices of which datanodes to use
        - Include failover handling
    - For EC, link to the [EC feature page](../features/erasure-coding).
- Client validating checksums
