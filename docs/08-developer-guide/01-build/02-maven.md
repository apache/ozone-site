# Building Ozone With Maven

**TODO:** File a subtask under [HDDS-9861](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDDS-9861) and complete this page or section.

- Cover basic Maven commands to build and run tests.
- Document all the Ozone specific Maven flags we use to speed up or skip parts of the build, and when they are useful.
