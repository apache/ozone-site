# Running Ozone From Docker Compose

**TODO:** File a subtask under [HDDS-9861](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDDS-9861) and complete this page or section.

- Reference common clusters from acceptance tests that can be used.
- Define the Ozone runner image at `ozone-docker-runner` and its purpose to wrap Ozone binaries.
- How to define which image gets used in the cluster (runner or other pre-built image).
- Changing configurations in Docker Compose (`docker-config` file, transformation.py, etc).
