# Building Ozone Docker Images

**TODO:** File a subtask under [HDDS-9861](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDDS-9861) and complete this page or section.

- Point to the ozone-docker repo and define its purpose as a testing/demo image with Ozone binaries included.
- Point to the ozone-docker-runner repo and define its purpose as a test image where Ozone binaries can be mounted.
- Instructions for building the images from source, customizing architecture (arm).
