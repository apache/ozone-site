# Prerequisites to Build Ozone From Source

**TODO:** File a subtask under [HDDS-9861](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDDS-9861) and complete this page or section.

- Minimum maven and java versions required to build Ozone.
- Install other necessary libraries like Proto 2.5 or RocksDB if necessary.
- Setup on an aarch64 machine like Apple Silicon.
- Choosing which version to build (master vs. the corresponding tag names for each release).
