# Buckets

Buckets are the fundamental containers for storing objects (keys) within an Apache Ozone [Volume](../01-volumes/README.mdx). They provide a namespace grouping for related data and allow configuration of various storage properties.

## Key Topics

*   **[Overview](./01-overview.md):** Introduction to buckets, their place in the namespace, and key attributes.
*   **[Owners](./02-owners.md):** Understanding bucket ownership and its implications for permissions.
*   **[Quotas](./03-quotas.md):** Limiting namespace and storage space usage per bucket.
*   **[Layouts](./04-layouts/README.mdx):** Defining how keys are organized internally (Object Store vs. File System Optimized) and protocol compatibility.
*   **[Replication](./05-replication.md):** Configuring data durability and availability (RATIS vs. Erasure Coding).
*   **[Encryption (TDE)](./06-encryption.md):** Enabling transparent data encryption at rest using KMS.
*   **[Links](./07-links.md):** Creating symbolic links between buckets for flexible access paths and permissions.

Understanding these bucket-level concepts is essential for effectively managing data storage, access control, and resource consumption in Ozone.
