# Authorization With ACLs

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

This section covers Ozone's ACL support, which can be used to restrict access to different portions of the namespace once a user has authenticated with [Kerberos](../kerberos). To configure access for administrator operations that do not involve the Ozone namespace, see the [Administrator Guide](../../../administrator-guide/configuration/security/administrators).
