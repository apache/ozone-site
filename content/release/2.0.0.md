and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.0] - 2025-04-04

### Added

-   New pipeline choosing policy: CapacityPipelineChoosePolicy. This policy randomly chooses pipelines with relatively lower utilization. To use, configure `hdds.scm.pipeline.choose.policy.impl` to `org.apache.hadoop.hdds.scm.pipeline.choose.algorithms.CapacityPipelineChoosePolicy`. (HDDS-9345)
-   APIs to fetch single datanode specific information, reducing data transfer from server to client. (HDDS-9648)
-   Support for symmetric keys for delegation tokens. (HDDS-8829)
-   Hidden command (`ozone sh bucket set-encryption-key`) to reset bucket encryption key, addressing HDDS-7449. (HDDS-10142)
-   A Storage Container Manager (SCM) can now be decommissioned from a set of SCM nodes. (HDDS-7852)
-   Option to close all pipelines via CLI (`ozone admin pipeline close --all`). (HDDS-10742)
-   Command-line tool (`ozone debug read-replicas`) to read data from all block replicas for a key to help triage data corruption. (HDDS-5739)
-   Metrics to monitor bucket state including usage, quota, and available space. (HDDS-10476)

-   Fixed S3 CompleteMultipartUpload returning 500 Internal Server Error instead of S3-compliant InvalidRequest error when no parts are specified in the request body. (HDDS-11457)
-   Fixed multiple `IOzoneAuthorizer` instances potentially being created and leaked if Ratis snapshot installation fails repeatedly after stopping the metadata manager. (HDDS-11472)
-   Fixed `ozone sh volume delete` command line parsing error for `-r` option. (HDDS-11535) -> Resolved as part of HDDS-11346 fix.
-   Fixed `NullPointerException` in OM when overwriting an empty file using multipart upload in FSO buckets (versioning disabled). (HDDS-12131)
-   Fixed Replication Manager (`hdds.scm.replication.thread.interval`) interval configuration description to correctly state milliseconds instead of seconds. (HDDS-12144) -> Resolved by removing unsupported types.
-   Fixed Grafana dashboard for Chunk read/write rates using incorrect interval variable (`$__interval` instead of `$__rate_interval`). (HDDS-12112)
-   Fixed Replication Manager potentially expiring pending container deletes incorrectly instead of retrying them if the Datanode doesn't confirm deletion within the deadline. (HDDS-12127)
-   Fixed Replication Manager non-deterministically selecting replicas for deletion if preferred target nodes are overloaded, potentially deleting required replicas. (HDDS-12115)
-   Fixed delete container commands potentially running indefinitely or past their deadline due to long lock waits or slow disk I/O; added lock timeout and moved ICR earlier. (HDDS-12114)
-   Fixed Recon UI potentially switching from old UI to new UI automatically upon page refresh. (HDDS-12084)
-   Fixed missing local refresh button in new Recon UI's Disk Usage page to reload data for the current path without navigating back to root. (HDDS-12085)
-   Fixed unnecessary parameters "Source Volume" & "Source Bucket" appearing in the metadata table for non-link buckets in the new Recon UI Disk Usage page. (HDDS-12073)
-   Fixed Recon API endpoints `/api/v1/volumes` and `/api/v1/buckets` missing from Swagger documentation. (HDDS-11300)
-   Fixed potential `NullPointerException` in Recon `/api/v1/volumes` and `/api/v1/buckets` endpoints if accessed before Recon tables are fully initialized after startup. (HDDS-11349)
-   Fixed `ozone freon cr` (closed container replication) command failing with NPE due to metrics map lookup failure in ReplicationSupervisor. (HDDS-12040)
-   Fixed incorrect display of Ozone Service ID name in Recon UI (New UI showed "OM ID", Old UI showed "OM Service"). Corrected to "Ozone Service ID". (HDDS-12049)
-   Fixed difference in Cluster Capacity % calculation (floor vs round) and Container Pre-Allocated Size display (committed vs 0) between new and old Recon UI. (HDDS-12042)
-   Fixed long path names wrapping to the next line in the new Recon UI Disk Usage page; made it scrollable instead. (HDDS-11957)
-   Fixed Recon failing to update `version_number` in `RECON_SCHEMA_VERSION` table (always -1), causing upgrade actions to run unnecessarily on fresh installs. (HDDS-11846)
-   Fixed serialization error (`Conflicting/ambiguous property name`) in Recon's listKeys API due to Jackson ambiguity between `key` field and `isKey()` getter. Renamed getter. (HDDS-11848)
-   Fixed potential deadlock in OM between DoubleBuffer flush thread (waiting for DeletedTable lock during snapshot checkpoint) and KeyDeletingService (holding DeletedTable lock, waiting for Ratis future). (HDDS-11124)
-   Fixed OM crashing with `IOException: Rocks Database is closed` during `SnapshotMoveDeletedKeys` request processing if the snapshot was purged concurrently. (HDDS-11152)
-   Fixed containers potentially stuck in DELETING state after upgrade if they were affected by HDDS-8129 (incorrect block counts) and datanodes rejected delete commands due to negative counts. Added recovery logic. (HDDS-11136)
-   Fixed `fs -mkdir` incorrectly creating directories in OBS buckets (bypassing layout validation added in HDDS-11235). Reverted the optimization for mkdir. (HDDS-11348)
-   Fixed Datanode potentially failing heartbeats or other operations due to deadlock on `StateContext#pipelineActions` map under high load. Replaced with concurrent map. (HDDS-11331)
-   Fixed S3 gateway returning 403 Forbidden instead of 302 Redirect for root path (`/`) requests containing `Authorization: Negotiate` header (used by newer curl versions). (HDDS-11096)
-   Fixed `DELETE_TENANT` request logging an unnecessary and uninformative `UPDATE_VOLUME` audit entry, even on failure. (HDDS-11119)
-   Fixed intermittent timeout in `TestBlockDeletion.testBlockDeletion` potentially caused by race conditions or slow command processing. (HDDS-9962)
-   Fixed "Bad file descriptor" error in `TestOmSnapshotFsoWithNativeLib.testSnapshotCompactionDag` when using native RocksDB tools library. (HDDS-10149)
-   Fixed `ManagedStatistics` objects not being closed properly in OM and DN when RocksDB statistics are enabled, leading to resource leaks. (HDDS-10184)
-   Fixed race condition in `RocksDatabase` where a close operation could occur between `assertClose()` check and database operation, causing JVM crash. (HDDS-9527)
-   Fixed ReplicationManager metrics not being re-registered after RM restart via CLI (`stop`/`start`), causing metrics to stop reporting. (HDDS-9235)
-   Fixed infinite loop in `WritableRatisContainerProvider.getContainer` if SCM restarts and existing pipeline nodes are not found (e.g., DNs stopped), causing log flooding. (HDDS-8982)
-   Fixed SCM follower nodes logging `NotLeaderException` errors when processing Pipeline Reports, which is expected behavior for followers. Suppressed error logging. (HDDS-11695)
-   Fixed `FileNotFoundException: ... (Too many open files)` and subsequent DN crashes during OM+DN decommission under heavy Freon load, likely due to excessive open file handles. (HDDS-11391) -> Addressed potential causes.
-   Fixed Recon showing incorrect (zero) count for DELETED containers in cluster state summary API (`/api/v1/clusterState`). (HDDS-11389)
-   Fixed issue where OM could fail if `IOzoneAuthorizer` (e.g., Ranger plugin) fails to initialize during snapshot installation and reload attempts create multiple instances, leading to heap exhaustion. (HDDS-11472)
-   Fixed `NoSuchUpload` error when aborting multipart uploads for keys where the parent directory was missing (potentially due to FSO-related bugs or cleanup issues). (HDDS-11784)
-   Fixed secure acceptance tests failing on arm64 due to keytab checksum mismatch when using keytabs generated on amd64. Regenerated keytabs for multi-arch compatibility. (HDDS-11810)
-   Fixed race condition in datanode VERSION file creation where multiple threads could attempt to write using the same temporary file via `AtomicFileOutputStream`. (HDDS-12608)
-   Fixed SCM logging an error when updating sequence ID for a CLOSED container based on a replica report with higher BCSID; changed log level and added context. (HDDS-12409)

### Security

-   Disabled REST endpoint for S3 secret manipulation by username for non-admin users via S3Gateway Secret REST endpoint. (HDDS-11040)
