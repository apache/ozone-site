## To verify Apache Ozone releases using GPG:

1.  Download the release ozone-X.Y.Z-src.tar.gz from a [mirror
    site](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/ozone).
2.  Download the signature file ozone-X.Y.Z-src.tar.gz.asc from
    [Apache](https://downloads.apache.org/ozone/).
3.  Download the Ozone [KEYS](https://downloads.apache.org/ozone/KEYS)
    file.
4.  `gpg --import KEYS`
5.  `gpg --verify ozone-X.Y.Z-src.tar.gz.asc ozone-X.Y.Z-src.tar.gz`

## To perform a quick check using SHA-512:

1.  Download the release ozone-X.Y.Z-src.tar.gz from a [mirror
    site](https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/hadoop/ozone).
2.  Download the checksum ozone-X.Y.Z-src.tar.gz.sha512 from
    [Apache](https://downloads.apache.org/ozone/).
3.  `sha512sum -c ozone-X.Y.Z-src.tar.gz`

Note: Before 1.1.0 release Ozone was part of the Apache Hadoop project. Older release artifacts can be found [there](https://archive.apache.org/dist/hadoop/ozone/).
