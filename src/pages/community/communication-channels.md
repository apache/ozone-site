### Slack Best Practices

- For complex questions, consider using the mailing list or GitHub Discussions
- Be aware that not all community members are online at the same time due to different time zones
- Important discussions and decisions should be moved to the mailing list
- Slack history might not be permanently archived, so don't rely on it for important information

### How to Use Jira

3. **Report a new issue**:
   - Click "Create" in the top menu
   - Use a clear, descriptive title
   - Include detailed steps to reproduce bugs
   - For feature requests, explain the use case and desired outcome
   - Add relevant labels (e.g., "newbie" for beginner-friendly issues)
   - Set the issue type (Bug, Improvement, New Feature, etc.)

4. **Work on an issue**:
   - Comment on the issue to express your interest
   - Assign it to yourself if you plan to work on it
   - Follow the [contribution guidelines](how-to-contribute) to submit a fix
