## Ways to Contribute

Apache Ozone welcomes contributions in many forms, not just code. Here are various ways you can contribute:

### Code Contributions

#### Finding Issues to Work On

- **Newbie Issues**: Start with [beginner-friendly issues](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDDS-12179?jql=labels%20%3D%20newbie%20AND%20project%20%3D%20%22Apache%20Ozone%22%20AND%20status%20%3D%20open%20ORDER%20BY%20created) that are good entry points
- **All Open Issues**: Browse [unassigned Jira issues](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDDS-12179?jql=labels%20%3D%20newbie%20AND%20project%20%3D%20%22Apache%20Ozone%22%20AND%20status%20%3D%20open%20ORDER%20BY%20created) to find something that matches your interests and skills

#### Making Code Changes

1. **Set Up Development Environment**
   - Fork and clone the repository
   - Enable the `build-branch` GitHub Actions workflow in your fork

2. **Create a Branch**
   - Ensure a Jira issue exists for your task (e.g., HDDS-1234)
   - Create a branch for your work: `git checkout -b HDDS-1234`

3. **Develop Your Changes**
   - [Follow code style guidelines](https://github.com/apache/ozone/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-convention-and-tests)
   - Write tests for your changes
   - Run relevant checks from `hadoop-ozone/dev-support/checks/` directory

4. **Submit Your Contribution**
   - Push changes to your fork
   - Wait for the `build-branch` workflow to complete
   - Create a pull request following the template used. (PRs pushed to master first and then if needed to a release branch)
   - Update the Jira issue status to "Patch Available"
   - Once the PR is merged close the Jira if completely resolved. 

### Reviewing Code and Design

Code reviews are a crucial part of the Apache Ozone development process. Reviewing others' code not only helps maintain quality but is also an excellent way to learn about the codebase.

#### How to Review Pull Requests

1. **Browse Open PRs**: Visit the [open pull requests](https://github.com/apache/ozone/pulls) on GitHub
2. **Choose PRs to Review**: Start with PRs in areas you're familiar with or interested in learning
3. **Run the Code**: When possible, check out the PR branch and test it locally
4. **Review Checklist**:
   - Does the code follow project style guidelines?
   - Are there sufficient tests for the new functionality?
   - Is the documentation updated?
   - Is the design sound and consistent with the rest of the codebase?
   - Does the code address the issue described in the linked Jira?
